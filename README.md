## Gene-based Classification of Alzheimer Disease using Random Forest and Recursive Feature Elimination
This repository contains code in predicting whether a sample is having Alzheimer's disease or not based on the gene expression using Recursive Feature Elimination as feature selection method and Random Forest as the classifer. It involves dealing with large dataset, comprising 54675 features and 254 samples. </br></br>
The Alzheimerâ€™s Disease dataset (GEO48350) was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through the link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48350. </br>
